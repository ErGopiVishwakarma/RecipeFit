This exquisite treat is made by melting dark chocolate and spreading it on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Fresh raspberries are then scattered over the melted chocolate, and dried rose petals are gently pressed into the surface, adding a delicate and aromatic touch. Once the chocolate has cooled and hardened, it's broken into irregular pieces to create the beautiful and indulgent chocolate bark. The combination of flavors and textures in this bark makes it a perfect gift or a stunning addition to any dessert table or special occasion.",
